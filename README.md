# Dog Image Fetcher üê∂

This project is a simple web application that fetches random dog images from the [Dog CEO's Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and displays them on the page when a button is clicked. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript with asynchronous functions, `axios`, and DOM manipulation.
